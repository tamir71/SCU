1. Run the commands:
    `$ setup vmware`
    `$ minix-get-image`
    `$ vmware &`

2. This will open the VMWare application.
    a. Go to Minix3 and click start VM.

3. Login as root, and you can set a password with passwd if you so wish

4. Now we can start file transfer.
    a. In your virtual machine: `# tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &`
    b. In your virtual machine: `# ifconfig`, this will give you the IP address that you will FTP into
    c. In your host machine: `ftp <xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx>` (your IP address)

5. Now that we have setup the ftp server, run all commands on your host machine:
    a. `$ cd /usr/src/kernel`
    b. `$ get proc.c`
    c. This will put the main.c onto your host machine's home directory
    d. Edit your file however you want on your host machine (vi/emacs/tEdit) and save the changes
    e. Now you can put it back with `$ put proc.c`

6. The changes that were created could be found on the function called `pick_process()`
    a. Inside the for loop, there is a line that checks if there is a process that is ready in that priority (q)
    b. The change I implemented was to make sure that 30% of the time, (creating a random integer mod 10), I just skip that priority (q++)
    c. This makes sure that each priority is reached, but it doesn't always hit the higher priority before lower priority processes.

7. The changes in proc.c should be put back into the kernel folder.
    a. Now in your virtual machine: `# cd /usr/src`
    b. `# make world`, this will remake your kernel and will take a minute

8. I didn't implement a secondary program to show that my changes to the scheduler were implemented.
    a. The 30% chance to choose a lower priority process already showed enough difference to show that the schuduler has been changed.
    b. Rebooting a fresh Minix would take approximately 5 seconds, and it would take you to the login screen
    c. After the 30% change, the OS took over 3 minutes to reach the login screen.
    d. Even after logging in, simple functions such as `ls` took a good one or two seconds to get through.
