### Part 1

Needed to add include <fcntl.h> to the function. Worked when you rename all "mutex" to "mutex2" in the code.

Running the code, the enter in order, but can enter before the previous threads have been returned in the first place.
            Thread 0 Entered Critical Section..
            Thread 1 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 0 returned 
            Thread 2 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 1 returned 
            Thread 3 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 2 returned 
                        Thread 3 returned 
            Thread 4 Entered Critical Section..
            Thread 5 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 4 returned 
            Thread 6 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 5 returned 
            Thread 7 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 6 returned 
            Thread 8 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 7 returned 
            Thread 9 Entered Critical Section..
                        Thread 8 returned 
                        Thread 9 returned 
            Main thread done.
They enter and return in order, and main thread done always at the end. The order between when a new thread joins and when a thread is returned is arbritary, as long as they are loosely bounded.


### Part 2

The producer at the start keeps on producing, and the consumer waits until the buffer becomes full. Once the buffer becomes full then the consumer starts consuming. After each "consume" the producer is able to produce once more. So, at the start producer produces a lot, then after that it becomes a push-pull relationship, alternating arbitrarily based on the scheduler.
