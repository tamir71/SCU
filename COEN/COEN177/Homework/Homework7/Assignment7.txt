1. ____ allows a thread to run on only one processor

Processor affinity.

2. The two general approaches to load balancing are __ and __.

Push migration, pull migration.

3. Which of the following is true of earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling algorithm?

When a process becomes runnable, it must announce its deadline requirements to the system.

4. For the following workload of five processes, the average waiting time using FIFO and SJF are:

28, 13

5. For the following workload of three processes, the average waiting time using SRTF are:

None of the above (1.0, 3.2, 4.2)

6. Consider two processes, P1 and P2, where p1 = 50, t1 = 25, p2 = 75, and t2 = 30. Can these two processes be scheduled using rate-monotonic scheduling?

No.

7. Write a simulated CPU scheduling application in C for an uniprocessor system. Include at least SCFS, RR, and SJC scheduling methods. Feel free to design your application in a way that it makes user friendly in terms of selection of scheduling method, workload, and performance.
