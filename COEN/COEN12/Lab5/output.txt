SCENE II
A camp near Forres Alarum within

Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox with Attendants
meeting a bleeding Sergeant

 DUNCAN What bloody man is that He can report
 As seemeth by his plight of the revolt
 The newest state
 MALCOLM This is the sergeant
 Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
 Gainst my captivity Hail brave friend
 Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
 As thou didst leave it
 SERGEANT Doubtful it stood
 As two spent swimmers that do cling together
 And choke their art The merciless Macdonwald 
 Worthy to be a rebel for to that
 The multiplying villainies of nature
 Do swarm upon him from the Western Isles
 Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
 And Fortune on his damned quarrel smiling 
 Showd like a rebels whore But alls too weak
 For brave Macbeth well he deserves that name 
 Disdaining Fortune with his brandishd steel
 Which smoked with bloody execution
 Like Valors minion carved out his passage
 Till he faced the slave
 Which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him
 Till he unseamd him from the nave to the chaps
 And fixd his head upon our battlements
 DUNCAN O valiant cousin Worthy gentleman
 SERGEANT As whence the sun gins his reflection
 Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
 So from that spring whence comfort seemd to come
 Discomfort swells Mark King of Scotland mark
 No sooner justice had with valor armd
 Compelld these skipping kerns to trust their heels
 But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
 With furbishd arms and new supplies of men
 Began a fresh assault
 DUNCAN Dismayd not this 
 Our captains Macbeth and Banquo
 SERGEANT Yes
 As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
 If I say sooth I must report they were
 As cannons overcharged with double cracks
 So they
 Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
 Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
 Or memorize another Golgotha
 I cannot tell 
 But I am faint my gashes cry for help
 DUNCAN So well thy words become thee as thy wounds
 They smack of honor both Go get him surgeons
 Exit Sergeant attended
 Who comes here

 Enter Ross

 MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross
 LENNOX What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look 
 That seems to speak things strange
 ROSS God save the King
 DUNCAN Whence camest thou worthy Thane
 ROSS From Fife great King
 Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
 And fan our people cold
 Norway himself with terrible numbers
 Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
 The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
 Till that Bellonas bridegroom lappd in proof
 Confronted him with self comparisons
 Point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
 Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
 The victory fell on us
 DUNCAN Great happiness
 ROSS That now
 Sweno the Norways king craves composition
 Nor would we deign him burial of his men
 Till he disbursed at Saint Colmes Inch
 Ten thousand dollars to our general use 
 DUNCAN No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
 Our bosom interest Go pronounce his present death
 And with his former title greet Macbeth
 ROSS Ill see it done
 DUNCAN What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won
 Exeunt




SCENE III

 SECOND WITCH Ill give thee a wind
 FIRST WITCH Thourt kind
 THIRD WITCH And I another
 FIRST WITCH I myself have all the other
 And the very ports they blow
 All the quarters that they know

 I will drain him dry as hay
 Sleep shall neither night nor day
 Hang upon his penthouse lid

 Weary sennights nine times nine
 Shall he dwindle peak and pine
 Though his bark cannot be lost
 Yet it shall be tempest tossd
 Look what I have
 SECOND WITCH Show me show me
 FIRST WITCH Here I have a pilots thumb
 Wreckd as homeward he did come Drum within
 THIRD WITCH A drum a drum
 Macbeth doth come
 ALL The weird sisters hand in hand
 Posters of the sea and land
 Thus do go about about
 Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
 And thrice again to make up nine
 Peace The charms wound up 

 Enter Macbeth and Banquo

 MACBETH So foul and fair a day I have not seen
 BANQUO How far ist calld to Forres What are these
 So witherd and so wild in their attire
 That look not like the inhabitants o the earth
 And yet are ont Live you or are you aught
 That man may question You seem to understand me
 By each at once her choppy finger laying
 Upon her skinny lips You should be women
 And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
 That you are so
 MACBETH Speak if you can What are you
 FIRST WITCH All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Glamis
 SECOND WITCH All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Cawdor
 THIRD WITCH All hail Macbeth that shalt be King hereafter
 BANQUO Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
 Things that do sound so fair I the name of truth
 Are ye fantastical or that indeed 
 Which outwardly ye show My noble partner
 You greet with present grace and great prediction
 Of noble having and of royal hope
 That he seems rapt withal To me you speak not
 If you can look into the seeds of time
 And say which grain will grow and which will not
 Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
 Your favors nor your hate
 FIRST WITCH Hail
 SECOND WITCH Hail
 THIRD WITCH Hail
 FIRST WITCH Lesser than Macbeth and greater
 SECOND WITCH Not so happy yet much happier
 THIRD WITCH Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
 So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
 FIRST WITCH Banquo and Macbeth all hail
 MACBETH Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
 By Sinels death I know I am Thane of Glamis
 But how of Cawdor The Thane of Cawdor lives
 A prosperous gentleman and to be King 
 Stands not within the prospect of belief
 No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
 You owe this strange intelligence or why
 Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
 With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you
 Witches vanish
 BANQUO The earth hath bubbles as the water has
 And these are of them Whither are they vanishd
 MACBETH Into the air and what seemd corporal melted
 As breath into the wind Would they had stayd
 BANQUO Were such things here as we do speak about
 Or have we eaten on the insane root
 That takes the reason prisoner
 MACBETH Your children shall be kings
 BANQUO You shall be King
 MACBETH And Thane of Cawdor too Went it not so
 BANQUO To the selfsame tune and words Whos here

 Enter Ross and Angus
 
 ROSS The King hath happily received Macbeth
 The news of thy success and when he reads
 Thy personal venture in the rebels fight
 His wonders and his praises do contend
 Which should be thine or his Silenced with that
 In viewing oer the rest o the selfsame day
 He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks
 Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
 Strange images of death As thick as hail
 Came post with post and every one did bear
 Thy praises in his kingdoms great defense
 And pourd them down before him
 ANGUS We are sent
 To give thee from our royal master thanks
 Only to herald thee into his sight
 Not pay thee
 ROSS And for an earnest of a greater honor
 He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor
 In which addition hail most worthy Thane
 For it is thine 
 BANQUO What can the devil speak true
 MACBETH The Thane of Cawdor lives Why do you dress me
 In borrowd robes
 ANGUS Who was the Thane lives yet
 But under heavy judgement bears that life
 Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined
 With those of Norway or did line the rebel
 With hidden help and vantage or that with both
 He labord in his countrys wreck I know not
 But treasons capital confessd and proved
 Have overthrown him
 MACBETH Aside Glamis and Thane of Cawdor
 The greatest is behind To Ross and Angus Thanks for your
 pains
 Aside to Banquo Do you not hope your children shall be
kings
 When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
 Promised no less to them
 BANQUO Aside to Macbeth That trusted home
 Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
 Besides the Thane of Cawdor But tis strange 
 And oftentimes to win us to our harm
 The instruments of darkness tell us truths
 Win us with honest trifles to betrays
 In deepest consequence 
 Cousins a word I pray you
 MACBETH Aside Two truths are told
 As happy prologues to the swelling act
 Of the imperial theme I thank you gentlemen
 Aside This supernatural soliciting
 Cannot be ill cannot be good If ill
 Why hath it given me earnest of success
 Commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor
 If good why do I yield to that suggestion
 Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
 And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
 Against the use of nature Present fears
 Are less than horrible imaginings
 My thought whose murther yet is but fantastical
 Shakes so my single state of man that function
 Is smotherd in surmise and nothing is 
 But what is not
 BANQUO Look how our partners rapt
 MACBETH Aside If chance will have me King why chance may
 crown me
 Without my stir
 BANQUO New honors come upon him
 Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
 But with the aid of use
 MACBETH Aside Come what come may
 Time and the hour runs through the roughest day
 BANQUO Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure
 MACBETH Give me your favor my dull brain was wrought
 With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains
 Are registerd where every day I turn
 The leaf to read them Let us toward the King
 Think upon what hath chanced and at more time
 The interim having weighd it let us speak
 Our free hearts each to other
 BANQUO Very gladly
 MACBETH Till then enough Come friends Exeunt




SCENE IV
Forres The palace

Flourish Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox and
Attendants

 DUNCAN Is execution done on Cawdor Are not
 Those in commission yet returnd
 MALCOLM My liege
 They are not yet come back But I have spoke
 With one that saw him die who did report
 That very frankly he confessd his treasons
 Implored your Highness pardon and set forth
 A deep repentance Nothing in his life
 Became him like the leaving it he died
 As one that had been studied in his death
 To throw away the dearest thing he owed
 As twere a careless trifle
 DUNCAN Theres no art
 To find the minds construction in the face
 He was a gentleman on whom I built
 An absolute trust 

 Enter Macbeth Banquo Ross and Angus

 O worthiest cousin
 The sin of my ingratitude even now
 Was heavy on me Thou art so far before
 That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
 To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deserved
 That the proportion both of thanks and payment
 Might have been mine Only I have left to say
 More is thy due than more than all can pay
 MACBETH The service and the loyalty lowe
 In doing it pays itself Your Highness part
 Is to receive our duties and our duties
 Are to your throne and state children and servants
 Which do but what they should by doing everything
 Safe toward your love and honor
 DUNCAN Welcome hither
 I have begun to plant thee and will labor
 To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo 
 That hast no less deserved nor must be known
 No less to have done so let me infold thee
 And hold thee to my heart
 BANQUO There if I grow
 The harvest is your own
 DUNCAN My plenteous joys
 Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves
 In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes
 And you whose places are the nearest know
 We will establish our estate upon
 Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
 The Prince of Cumberland which honor must
 Not unaccompanied invest him only
 But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
 On all deservers From hence to Inverness
 And bind us further to you
 MACBETH The rest is labor which is not used for you
 Ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful
 The hearing of my wife with your approach
 So humbly take my leave 
 DUNCAN My worthy Cawdor
 MACBETH Aside The Prince of Cumberland That is a step
 On which I must fall down or else oerleap
 For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
 Let not light see my black and deep desires
 The eye wink at the hand yet let that be
 Which the eye fears when it is done to see Exit
 DUNCAN True worthy Banquo He is full so valiant
 And in his commendations I am fed
 It is a banquet to me Lets after him
 Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
 It is a peerless kinsman Flourish Exeunt




SCENE V
Inverness Macbeths castle

Enter Lady Macbeth reading a letter

 LADY MACBETH They met me in the day of success and I have
 learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
 mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them
 further they made themselves air into which they vanished
 Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from
the
 King who all hailed me Thane of Cawdor by which title
 before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
 coming on of time with Hail King that shalt be This have
I
 thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of
greatness
 that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being
 ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy
heart
 and farewell

 Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
 What thou art promised Yet do I fear thy nature
 It is too full o the milk of human kindness
 To catch the nearest way Thou wouldst be great 
 Art not without ambition but without
 The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly
 That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
 And yet wouldst wrongly win Thouldst have great Glamis
 That which cries Thus thou must do if thou have it
 And that which rather thou dost fear to do
 Than wishest should be undone Hie thee hither
 That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
 And chastise with the valor of my tongue
 All that impedes thee from the golden round
 Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
 To have thee crownd withal

 Enter a Messenger

 What is your tidings
 MESSENGER The King comes here tonight
 LADY MACBETH Thourt mad to say it
 Is not thy master with him who weret so
 Would have informd for preparation 
 MESSENGER So please you it is true our Thane is coming
 One of my fellows had the speed of him
 Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
 Than would make up his message
 LADY MACBETH Give him tending
 He brings great news Exit Messenger
 The raven himself is hoarse
 That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
 Under my battlements Come you spirits
 That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
 And fill me from the crown to the toe top full
 Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood
 Stop up the access and passage to remorse
 That no compunctious visitings of nature
 Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
 The effect and it Come to my womans breasts
 And take my milk for gall your murthering ministers
 Wherever in your sightless substances
 You wait on natures mischief Come thick night
 And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell 
 That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
 Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
 To cry Hold hold

 Enter Macbeth

 Great Glamis Worthy Cawdor
 Greater than both by the all hail hereafter
 Thy letters have transported me beyond
 This ignorant present and I feel now
 The future in the instant
 MACBETH My dearest love
 Duncan comes here tonight
 LADY MACBETH And when goes hence
 MACBETH Tomorrow as he purposes
 LADY MACBETH O never
 Shall sun that morrow see
 Your face my Thane is as a book where men
 May read strange matters To beguile the time
 Look like the time bear welcome in your eye 
 Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
 But be the serpent under it He thats coming
 Must be provided for and you shall put
 This nights great business into my dispatch
 Which shall to all our nights and days to come
 Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
 MACBETH We will speak further
 LADY MACBETH Only look up clear
 To alter favor ever is to fear
 Leave all the rest to me Exeunt




SCENE VI
Before Macbeths castle Hautboys and torches

Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Banquo Lennox Macduff Ross
Angus
and Attendants

 DUNCAN This castle hath a pleasant seat the air
 Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
 Unto our gentle senses
 BANQUO This guest of summer
 The temple haunting martlet does approve
 By his loved mansionry that the heavens breath
 Smells wooingly here No jutty frieze
 Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
 Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle
 Where they most breed and haunt I have observed
 The air is delicate

 Enter Lady Macbeth

 DUNCAN See see our honord hostess
 The love that follows us sometime is our trouble 
 Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you
 How you shall bid God ield us for your pains
 And thank us for your trouble
 LADY MACBETH All our service
 In every point twice done and then done double
 Were poor and single business to contend
 Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
 Your Majesty loads our house For those of old
 And the late dignities heapd up to them
 We rest your hermits
 DUNCAN Wheres the Thane of Cawdor
 We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
 To be his purveyor but he rides well
 And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
 To his home before us Fair and noble hostess
 We are your guest tonight
 LADY MACBETH Your servants ever
 Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
 To make their audit at your Highness pleasure
 Still to return your own 
 DUNCAN Give me your hand
 Conduct me to mine host We love him highly
 And shall continue our graces towards him
 By your leave hostess Exeunt




SCENE VII
Macbeths castle Hautboys and torches

Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service who
pass over
the stage Then enter Macbeth

 MACBETH If it were done when tis done then twere well
 It were done quickly If the assassination
 Could trammel up the consequence and catch
 With his surcease success that but this blow
 Might be the be all and the end all here
 But here upon this bank and shoal of time
 Weld jump the life to come But in these cases
 We still have judgement here that we but teach
 Bloody instructions which being taught return
 To plague the inventor This even handed justice
 Commends the ingredients of our poisond chalice
 To our own lips Hes here in double trust
 First as I am his kinsman and his subject
 Strong both against the deed then as his host
 Who should against his murtherer shut the door 
 Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan
 Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
 So clear in his great office that his virtues
 Will plead like angels trumpet tongued against
 The deep damnation of his taking off
 And pity like a naked new born babe
 Striding the blast or heavens cherubin horsed
 Upon the sightless couriers of the air
 Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
 That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
 To prick the sides of my intent but only
 Vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself
 And falls on the other

 Enter Lady Macbeth

 How now what news
 LADY MACBETH He has almost suppd Why have you left the
chamber
 MACBETH Hath he askd for me
 LADY MACBETH Know you not he has 
 MACBETH We will proceed no further in this business
 He hath honord me of late and I have bought
 Golden opinions from all sorts of people
 Which would be worn now in their newest gloss
 Not cast aside so soon
 LADY MACBETH Was the hope drunk
 Wherein you dressd yourself Hath it slept since
 And wakes it now to look so green and pale
 At what it did so freely From this time
 Such I account thy love Art thou afeard
 To be the same in thine own act and valor
 As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
 Which thou esteemst the ornament of life
 And live a coward in thine own esteem
 Letting I dare not wait upon I would
 Like the poor cat i the adage
 MACBETH Prithee peace
 I dare do all that may become a man
 Who dares do more is none
 LADY MACBETH What beast wast then 
 That made you break this enterprise to me
 When you durst do it then you were a man
 And to be more than what you were you would
 Be so much more the man Nor time nor place
 Did then adhere and yet you would make both
 They have made themselves and that their fitness now
 Does unmake you I have given suck and know
 How tender tis to love the babe that milks me 
 I would while it was smiling in my face
 Have pluckd my nipple from his boneless gums
 And dashd the brains out had I so sworn as you
 Have done to this
 MACBETH If we should fail
 LADY MACBETH We fail
 But screw your courage to the sticking place
 And well not fail When Duncan is asleep 
 Whereto the rather shall his days hard journey
 Soundly invite him his two chamberlains
 Will I with wine and wassail so convince
 That memory the warder of the brain 
 Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
 A limbeck only When in swinish sleep
 Their drenched natures lie as in a death
 What cannot you and I perform upon
 The unguarded Duncan What not put upon
 His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
 Of our great quell
 MACBETH Bring forth men children only
 For thy undaunted mettle should compose
 Nothing but males Will it not be received
 When we have markd with blood those sleepy two
 Of his own chamber and used their very daggers
 That they have donet
 LADY MACBETH Who dares receive it other
 As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
 Upon his death
 MACBETH I am settled and bend up
 Each corporal agent to this terrible feat
 Away and mock the time with fairest show
 False face must hide what the false heart doth know 
 Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
Inverness Court of Macbeths castle

Enter Banquo and Fleance bearing a torch before him

 BANQUO How goes the night boy
 FLEANCE The moon is down I have not heard the clock
 BANQUO And she goes down at twelve
 FLEANCE I taket tis later sir
 BANQUO Hold take my sword Theres husbandry in heaven
 Their candles are all out Take thee that too
 A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
 And yet I would not sleep Merciful powers
 Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
 Gives way to in repose

 Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch

 Give me my sword
 Whos there
 MACBETH A friend
 BANQUO What sir not yet at rest The Kings abed 
 He hath been in unusual pleasure and
 Sent forth great largess to your offices
 This diamond he greets your wife withal
 By the name of most kind hostess and shut up
 In measureless content
 MACBETH Being unprepared
 Our will became the servant to defect
 Which else should free have wrought
 BANQUO Alls well
 I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
 To you they have showd some truth
 MACBETH I think not of them
 Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
 We would spend it in some words upon that business
 If you would grant the time
 BANQUO At your kindst leisure
 MACBETH If you shall cleave to my consent when tis
 It shall make honor for you
 BANQUO So I lose none
 In seeking to augment it but still keep 
 My bosom franchised and allegiance clear
 I shall be counseld
 MACBETH Good repose the while
 BANQUO Thanks sir the like to you
 Exeunt Banquo and Fleance
 MACBETH Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
 She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed Exit Servant
 Is this a dagger which I see before me
 The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee
 I have thee not and yet I see thee still
 Art thou not fatal vision sensible
 To feeling as to sight Or art thou but
 A dagger of the mind a false creation
 Proceeding from the heat oppressed brain
 I see thee yet in form as palpable
 As this which now I draw
 Thou marshalst me the way that I was going
 And such an instrument I was to use
 Mine eyes are made the fools o the other senses
 Or else worth all the rest I see thee still 
 And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
 Which was not so before Theres no such thing
 It is the bloody business which informs
 Thus to mine eyes Now oer the one half world
 Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
 The curtaind sleep witchcraft celebrates
 Pale Hecates offerings and witherd Murther
 Alarumd by his sentinel the wolf
 Whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace
 With Tarquins ravishing strides towards his design
 Moves like a ghost Thou sure and firm set earth
 Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
 Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
 And take the present horror from the time
 Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
 Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
 A bell rings
 I go and it is done the bell invites me
 Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
 That summons thee to heaven or to hell Exit




SCENE II
The same

Enter Lady Macbeth

 LADY MACBETH That which hath made them drunk hath made me
bold
 What hath quenchd them hath given me fire Hark Peace
 It was the owl that shriekd the fatal bellman
 Which gives the sternst good night He is about it
 The doors are open and the surfeited grooms
 Do mock their charge with snores I have druggd their
possets
 That death and nature do contend about them
 Whether they live or die
 MACBETH Within Whos there what ho
 LADY MACBETH Alack I am afraid they have awaked
 And tis not done The attempt and not the deed
 Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready
 He could not miss em Had he not resembled
 My father as he slept I had donet

 Enter Macbeth
 
 My husband
 MACBETH I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise
 LADY MACBETH I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
 Did not you speak
 MACBETH When
 LADY MACBETH Now
 MACBETH As I descended
 LADY MACBETH Ay
 MACBETH Hark
 Who lies i the second chamber
 LADY MACBETH Donalbain
 MACBETH This is a sorry sight Looks on his hands
 LADY MACBETH A foolish thought to say a sorry sight
 MACBETH Theres one did laugh in s sleep and one cried
 Murther
 That they did wake each other I stood and heard them
 But they did say their prayers and addressd them
 Again to sleep
 LADY MACBETH There are two lodged together
 MACBETH One cried God bless us and Amen the other 
 As they had seen me with these hangmans hands
 Listening their fear I could not say Amen
 When they did say God bless us
 LADY MACBETH Consider it not so deeply
 MACBETH But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen
 I had most need of blessing and Amen
 Stuck in my throat
 LADY MACBETH These deeds must not be thought
 After these ways so it will make us mad
 MACBETH I heard a voice cry Sleep no more
 Macbeth does murther sleep the innocent sleep
 Sleep that knits up the raveld sleave of care
 The death of each days life sore labors bath
 Balm of hurt minds great natures second course
 Chief nourisher in lifes feast 
 LADY MACBETH What do you mean
 MACBETH Still it cried Sleep no more to all the house
 Glamis hath murtherd sleep and therefore Cawdor
 Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more
 LADY MACBETH Who was it that thus cried Why worthy Thane 
 You do unbend your noble strength to think
 So brainsickly of things Go get some water
 And wash this filthy witness from your hand
 Why did you bring these daggers from the place
 They must lie there Go carry them and smear
 The sleepy grooms with blood
 MACBETH Ill go no more
 I am afraid to think what I have done
 Look ont again I dare not
 LADY MACBETH Infirm of purpose
 Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead
 Are but as pictures tis the eye of childhood
 That fears a painted devil If he do bleed
 Ill gild the faces of the grooms withal
 For it must seem their guilt Exit Knocking within
 MACBETH Whence is that knocking
 How ist with me when every noise appals me
 What hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes
 Will all great Neptunes ocean wash this blood
 Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather 
 The multitudinous seas incarnadine
 Making the green one red

 Re enter Lady Macbeth

 LADY MACBETH My hands are of your color but I shame
 To wear a heart so white Knocking within I hear knocking
 At the south entry Retire we to our chamber
 A little water clears us of this deed
 How easy is it then Your constancy
 Hath left you unattended Knocking within Hark more
knocking
 Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us
 And show us to be watchers Be not lost
 So poorly in your thoughts
 MACBETH To know my deed twere best not know myself
 Knocking within
 Wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldst
 Exeunt

 Enter Macduff and Lennox

 MACDUFF Was it so late friend ere you went to bed
 That you do lie so late
 PORTER Faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and
 drink sir is a great provoker of three things
 MACDUFF What three things does drink especially provoke
 PORTER Marry sir nose painting sleep and urine Lechery
sir
 it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it
takes
 away the performance Therefore much drink may be said to be
an
 equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it
sets
 him on and it takes him off it persuades him and
disheartens
 him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion
 equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves
him
 MACDUFF I believe drink gave thee the lie last night
 PORTER That it did sir i the very throat on me but
requited
 him for his lie and I think being too strong for him
though 
 he took up my legs sometime yet I made shift to cast him
 MACDUFF Is thy master stirring

 Enter Macbeth

 Our knocking has awaked him here he comes
 LENNOX Good morrow noble sir
 MACBETH morrow both
 MACDUFF Is the King stirring worthy Thane

 MACDUFF I know this is a joyful trouble to you
 But yet tis one
 MACBETH The labor we delight in physics pain
 This is the door
 MACDUFF Ill make so bold to call
 For tis my limited service Exit
 LENNOX Goes the King hence today 
 MACBETH He does he did appoint so
 LENNOX The night has been unruly Where we lay
 Our chimneys were blown down and as they say
 Lamentings heard i the air strange screams of death
 And prophesying with accents terrible
 Of dire combustion and confused events
 New hatchd to the woeful time The obscure bird
 Clamord the livelong night Some say the earth
 Was feverous and did shake
 MACBETH Twas a rough fight
 LENNOX My young remembrance cannot parallel
 A fellow to it

 Re enter Macduff

 MACDUFF O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart
 Cannot conceive nor name thee
 MACBETH LENNOX Whats the matter
 MACDUFF Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
 Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope 
 The Lords anointed temple and stole thence
 The life o the building
 MACBETH What ist you say the life
 LENNOX Mean you his Majesty
 MACDUFF Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
 With a new Gorgon Do not bid me speak
 See and then speak yourselves
 Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox
 Awake awake
 Ring the alarum bell Murther and treason
 Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake
 Shake off this downy sleep deaths counterfeit
 And look on death itself Up up and see
 The great dooms image Malcolm Banquo
 As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
 To countenance this horror Ring the bell Bell rings

 Enter Lady Macbeth

 LADY MACBETH Whats the business 
 That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
 The sleepers of the house Speak speak
 MACDUFF O gentle lady
 Tis not for you to hear what I can speak
 The repetition in a womans ear
 Would murther as it fell

 Enter Banquo

 O Banquo Banquo
 Our royal masters murtherd
 LADY MACBETH Woe alas
 What in our house
 BANQUO Too cruel anywhere
 Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself
 And say it is not so

 Re enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross

 MACBETH Had I but died an hour before this chance 
 I had lived a blessed time for from this instant
 Theres nothing serious in mortality
 All is but toys renown and grace is dead
 The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
 Is left this vault to brag of

 Enter Malcolm and Donalbain

 DONALBAIN What is amiss
 MACBETH You are and do not knowt
 The spring the head the fountain of your blood
 Is stopped the very source of it is stoppd
 MACDUFF Your royal fathers murtherd
 MALCOLM O by whom
 LENNOX Those of his chamber as it seemd had donet
 Their hands and faces were all badged with blood
 So were their daggers which unwiped we found
 Upon their pillows
 They stared and were distracted no mans life
 Was to be trusted with them 
 MACBETH O yet I do repent me of my fury
 That I did kill them
 MACDUFF Wherefore did you so
 MACBETH Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious
 Loyal and neutral in a moment No man
 The expedition of my violent love
 Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan
 His silver skin laced with his golden blood
 And his gashd stabs lookd like a breach in nature
 For ruins wasteful entrance there the murtherers
 Steepd in the colors of their trade their daggers
 Unmannerly breechd with gore Who could refrain
 That had a heart to love and in that heart
 Courage to make s love known
 LADY MACBETH Help me hence ho
 MACDUFF Look to the lady
 MALCOLM Aside to Donalbain Why do we hold our tongues
 That most may claim this argument for ours
 DONALBAIN Aside to Malcolm What should be spoken here
where
 our fate 
 Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
 Lets away
 Our tears are not yet brewd
 MALCOLM Aside to Donalbain Nor our strong sorrow
 Upon the foot of motion
 BANQUO Look to the lady
 Lady Macbeth is carried out
 And when we have our naked frailties hid
 That suffer in exposure let us meet
 And question this most bloody piece of work
 To know it further Fears and scruples shake us
 In the great hand of God I stand and thence
 Against the undivulged pretense I fight
 Of treasonous malice
 MACDUFF And so do I
 ALL So all
 MACBETH Lets briefly put on manly readiness
 And meet i the hall together
 ALL Well contented
 Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain 
 MALCOLM What will you do Lets not consort with them
 To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
 Which the false man does easy Ill to England
 DONALBAIN To Ireland I our separated fortune
 Shall keep us both the safer Where we are
 Theres daggers in mens smiles the near in blood
 The nearer bloody
 MALCOLM This murtherous shaft thats shot
 Hath not yet lighted and our safest way
 Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse
 And let us not be dainty of leave taking
 But shift away Theres warrant in that theft
 Which steals itself when theres no mercy left
 Exeunt




SCENE IV
Outside Macbeths castle

Enter Ross with an Old Man

 OLD MAN Threescore and ten I can remember well
 Within the volume of which time I have seen
 Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
 Hath trifled former knowings
 ROSS Ah good father
 Thou seest the heavens as troubled with mans act
 Threaten his bloody stage By the clock tis day
 And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp
 Ist nights predominance or the days shame
 That darkness does the face of earth entomb
 When living light should kiss it
 OLD MAN Tis unnatural
 Even like the deed thats done On Tuesday last
 A falcon towering in her pride of place
 Was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killd
 ROSS And Duncans horses a thing most strange and certain 
 Beauteous and swift the minions of their race 
 Turnd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out
 Contending gainst obedience as they would make
 War with mankind
 OLD MAN Tis said they eat each other
 ROSS They did so to the amazement of mine eyes
 That lookd upont

 Enter Macduff

 Here comes the good Macduff
 How goes the world sir now
 MACDUFF Why see you not
 ROSS Ist known who did this more than bloody deed
 MACDUFF Those that Macbeth hath slain
 ROSS Alas the day
 What good could they pretend
 MACDUFF They were subornd
 Malcolm and Donalbain the Kings two sons
 Are stoln away and fled which puts upon them
 Suspicion of the deed 
 ROSS Gainst nature still
 Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
 Thine own lifes means Then tis most like
 The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
 MACDUFF He is already named and gone to Scone
 To be invested
 ROSS Where is Duncans body
 MACDUFF Carried to Colmekill
 The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
 And guardian of their bones
 ROSS Will you to Scone
 MACDUFF No cousin Ill to Fife
 ROSS Well I will thither
 MACDUFF Well may you see things well done there
 Adieu
 Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
 ROSS Farewell father
 OLD MAN Gods benison go with you and with those
 That would make good of bad and friends of foes
 Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Forres The palace

Enter Banquo

 BANQUO Thou hast it now King Cawdor Glamis all
 As the weird women promised and I fear
 Thou playdst most foully fort yet it was said
 It should not stand in thy posterity
 But that myself should be the root and father
 Of many kings If there come truth from them
 As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine
 Why by the verities on thee made good
 May they not be my oracles as well
 And set me up in hope But hush no more

 Sennet sounds Enter Macbeth as King Lady Macbeth
 as Queen Lennox Ross Lords Ladies and Attendants

 MACBETH Heres our chief guest
 LADY MACBETH If he had been forgotten
 It had been as a gap in our great feast 
 And all thing unbecoming
 MACBETH Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
 And Ill request your presence
 BANQUO Let your Highness
 Command upon me to the which my duties
 Are with a most indissoluble tie
 Forever knit
 MACBETH Ride you this afternoon
 BANQUO Ay my good lord
 MACBETH We should have else desired your good advice
 Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
 In this days council but well take tomorrow
 Ist far you ride
 BANQUO As far my lord as will fill up the time
 Twixt this and supper Go not my horse the better
 I must become a borrower of the night
 For a dark hour or twain
 MACBETH Fail not our feast
 BANQUO My lord I will not
 MACBETH We hear our bloody cousins are bestowd 
 In England and in Ireland not confessing
 Their cruel parricide filling their hearers
 With strange invention But of that tomorrow
 When therewithal we shall have cause of state
 Craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu
 Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you
 BANQUO Ay my good lord Our time does call upon s
 MACBETH I wish your horses swift and sure of foot
 And so I do commend you to their backs
 Farewell Exit Banquo
 Let every man be master of his time
 Till seven at night to make society
 The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
 Till supper time alone While then God be with you
 Exeunt all but Macbeth and an Attendant
 Sirrah a word with you Attend those men
 Our pleasure
 ATTENDANT They are my lord without the palace gate
 MACBETH Bring them before us Exit Attendant
 To be thus is nothing 
 But to be safely thus Our fears in Banquo
 Stick deep and in his royalty of nature
 Reigns that which would be feard Tis much he dares
 And to that dauntless temper of his mind
 He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
 To act in safety There is none but he
 Whose being I do fear and under him
 My genius is rebuked as it is said
 Mark Antonys was by Caesar He chid the sisters
 When first they put the name of King upon me
 And bade them speak to him then prophet like
 They haild him father to a line of kings
 Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
 And put a barren sceptre in my gripe
 Thence to be wrenchd with an unlineal hand
 No son of mine succeeding Ift be so
 For Banquos issue have I filed my mind
 For them the gracious Duncan have I murtherd
 Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
 Only for them and mine eternal jewel 
 Given to the common enemy of man
 To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings
 Rather than so come Fate into the list
 And champion me to the utterance Whos there

 Re enter Attendant with two Murtherers

 Now go to the door and stay there till we call
 Exit Attendant
 Was it not yesterday we spoke together
 FIRST MURTHERER It was so please your Highness
 MACBETH Well then now
 Have you considerd of my speeches Know
 That it was he in the times past which held you
 So under fortune which you thought had been
 Our innocent self This I made good to you
 In our last conference passd in probation with you
 How you were borne in hand how crossd the instruments
 Who wrought with them and all things else that might
 To half a soul and to a notion crazed 
 Say Thus did Banquo
 FIRST MURTHERER You made it known to us
 MACBETH I did so and went further which is now
 Our point of second meeting Do you find
 Your patience so predominant in your nature
 That you can let this go Are you so gospeld
 To pray for this good man and for his issue
 Whose heavy hand hath bowd you to the grave
 And beggard yours forever
 FIRST MURTHERER We are men my liege
 MACBETH Ay in the catalogue ye go for men
 As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
 Shoughs waterrugs and demi wolves are clept
 All by the name of dogs The valued file
 Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
 The housekeeper the hunter every one
 According to the gift which bounteous nature
 Hath in him closed whereby he does receive
 Particular addition from the bill
 That writes them all alike and so of men 
 Now if you have a station in the file
 Not i the worst rank of manhood say it
 And I will put that business in your bosoms
 Whose execution takes your enemy off
 Grapples you to the heart and love of us
 Who wear our health but sickly in his life
 Which in his death were perfect
 SECOND MURTHERER I am one my liege
 Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
 Have so incensed that I am reckless what
 I do to spite the world
 FIRST MURTHERER And I another
 So weary with disasters tuggd with fortune
 That I would set my life on any chance
 To mend it or be rid ont
 MACBETH Both of you
 Know Banquo was your enemy
 BOTH MURTHERERS True my lord
 MACBETH So is he mine and in such bloody distance
 That every minute of his being thrusts 
 Against my nearst of life and though I could
 With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
 And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
 For certain friends that are both his and mine
 Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
 Who I myself struck down And thence it is
 That I to your assistance do make love
 Masking the business from the common eye
 For sundry weighty reasons
 SECOND MURTHERER We shall my lord
 Perform what you command us
 FIRST MURTHERER Though our lives 
 MACBETH Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at
most
 I will advise you where to plant yourselves
 Acquaint you with the perfect spy o the time
 The moment ont fort must be done tonight
 And something from the palace always thought
 That I require a clearness and with him 
 To leave no rubs nor botches in the work 
 Fleance his son that keeps him company 
 Whose absence is no less material to me
 Than is his fathers must embrace the fate
 Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart
 Ill come to you anon
 BOTH MURTHERERS We are resolved my lord
 MACBETH Ill call upon you straight Abide within
 Exeunt Murtherers
 It is concluded Banquo thy souls flight
 If it find heaven must find it out tonight Exit




SCENE II
The palace

Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant

 LADY MACBETH Is Banquo gone from court
 SERVANT Ay madam but returns again tonight
 LADY MACBETH Say to the King I would attend his leisure
 For a few words
 SERVANT Madam I will Exit
 LADY MACBETH Noughts had alls spent
 Where our desire is got without content
 Tis safer to be that which we destroy
 Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy

 Enter Macbeth

 How now my lord Why do you keep alone
 Of sorriest fancies your companions making
 Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
 With them they think on Things without all remedy
 Should be without regard Whats done is done 
 MACBETH We have scotchd the snake not killd it
 Shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice
 Remains in danger of her former tooth
 But let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer
 Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
 In the affliction of these terrible dreams
 That shake us nightly Better be with the dead
 Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
 Than on the torture of the mind to lie
 In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave
 After lifes fitful fever he sleeps well
 Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
 Malice domestic foreign levy nothing
 Can touch him further
 LADY MACBETH Come on
 Gentle my lord sleek oer your rugged looks
 Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
 MACBETH So shall I love and so I pray be you
 Let your remembrance apply to Banquo
 Present him eminence both with eye and tongue 
 Unsafe the while that we
 Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
 And make our faces vizards to our hearts
 Disguising what they are
 LADY MACBETH You must leave this
 MACBETH O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
 Thou knowst that Banquo and his Fleance lives
 LADY MACBETH But in them natures copys not eterne
 MACBETH Theres comfort yet they are assailable
 Then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown
 His cloisterd flight ere to black Hecates summons
 The shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums
 Hath rung nights yawning peal there shall be done
 A deed of dreadful note
 LADY MACBETH Whats to be done
 MACBETH Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
 Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night
 Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
 And with thy bloody and invisible hand
 Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond 
 Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow
 Makes wing to the rooky wood
 Good things of day begin to droop and drowse
 Whiles nights black agents to their preys do rouse
 Thou marvelst at my words but hold thee still
 Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
 So prithee go with me Exeunt




SCENE III
A park near the palace

 FIRST MURTHERER But who did bid thee join with us

 Our offices and what we have to do

 Now spurs the lated traveler apace
 To gain the timely inn and near approaches
 The subject of our watch
 THIRD MURTHERER Hark I hear horses
 BANQUO Within Give us a light there ho
 SECOND MURTHERER Then tis he the rest
 That are within the note of expectation
 Already are i the court

 That did the like for Fleance If thou didst it
 Thou art the nonpareil
 MURTHERER Most royal sir
 Fleance is scaped
 MACBETH Aside Then comes my fit again I had else been
perfect
 Whole as the marble founded as the rock
 As broad and general as the casing air
 But now I am cabind cribbd confind bound in
 To saucy doubts and fears But Banquos safe
 MURTHERER Ay my good lord Safe in a ditch he bides
 With twenty trenched gashes on his head
 The least a death to nature
 MACBETH Thanks for that
 There the grown serpent lies the worm thats fled 
 Hath nature that in time will venom breed
 No teeth for the present Get thee gone Tomorrow
 Well hear ourselves again
 Exit Murtherer
 LADY MACBETH My royal lord
 You do not give the cheer The feast is sold
 That is not often vouchd while tis amaking
 Tis given with welcome To feed were best at home
 From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
 Meeting were bare without it
 MACBETH Sweet remembrancer
 Now good digestion wait on appetite
 And health on both
 LENNOX Mayt please your Highness sit

 The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeths place

 MACBETH Here had we now our countrys honor roofd
 Were the graced person of our Banquo present
 Who may I rather challenge for unkindness 
 Than pity for mischance
 ROSS His absence sir
 Lays blame upon his promise Pleaset your Highness
 To grace us with your royal company
 MACBETH The tables full
 LENNOX Here is a place reserved sir
 MACBETH Where
 LENNOX Here my good lord What ist that moves your Highness
 MACBETH Which of you have done this
 LORDS What my good lord
 MACBETH Thou canst not say I did it never shake
 Thy gory locks at me
 ROSS Gentlemen rise his Highness is well
 LADY MACBETH Sit worthy friends my lord is often thus
 And hath been from his youth Pray you keep seat
 The fit is momentary upon a thought
 He will again be well If much you note him
 You shall offend him and extend his passion
 Feed and regard him not Are you a man
 MACBETH Ay and a bold one that dare look on that 
 Which might appal the devil
 LADY MACBETH O proper stuff
 This is the very painting of your fear
 This is the air drawn dagger which you said
 Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts
 Impostors to true fear would well become
 A womans story at a winters fire
 Authorized by her grandam Shame itself
 Why do you make such faces When alls done
 You look but on a stool
 MACBETH Prithee see there Behold Look Lo How say you
 Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too
 If charnel houses and our graves must send
 Those that we bury back our monuments
 Shall be the maws of kites Exit Ghost
 LADY MACBETH What quite unmannd in folly
 MACBETH If I stand here I saw him
 LADY MACBETH Fie for shame
 MACBETH Blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time
 Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal 
 Ay and since too murthers have been performd
 Too terrible for the ear The time has been
 That when the brains were out the man would die
 And there an end but now they rise again
 With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns
 And push us from our stools This is more strange
 Than such a murther is
 LADY MACBETH My worthy lord
 Your noble friends do lack you
 MACBETH I do forget
 Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
 I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
 To those that know me Come love and health to all
 Then Ill sit down Give me some wine fill full
 I drink to the general joy o the whole table
 And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
 Would he were here To all and him we thirst
 And all to all
 LORDS Our duties and the pledge
 
 Re enter Ghost

 MACBETH Avaunt and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee
 Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
 Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
 Which thou dost glare with
 LADY MACBETH Think of this good peers
 But as a thing of custom Tis no other
 Only it spoils the pleasure of the time
 MACBETH What man dare I dare
 Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
 The armd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger
 Take any shape but that and my firm nerves
 Shall never tremble Or be alive again
 And dare me to the desert with thy sword
 If trembling I inhabit then protest me
 The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow
 Unreal mockery hence Exit Ghost
 Why so being gone
 I am a man again Pray you sit still 
 LADY MACBETH You have displaced the mirth broke the good
meeting
 With most admired disorder
 MACBETH Can such things be
 And overcome us like a summers cloud
 Without our special wonder You make me strange
 Even to the disposition that I owe
 When now I think you can behold such sights
 And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
 When mine is blanchd with fear
 ROSS What sights my lord
 LADY MACBETH I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
 Question enrages him At once good night
 Stand not upon the order of your going
 But go at once
 LENNOX Good night and better health
 Attend his Majesty
 LADY MACBETH A kind good night to all
 Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth
 MACBETH will have blood they say blood will have blood
 Stones have been known to move and trees to speak 
 Augures and understood relations have
 By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
 The secretst man of blood What is the night
 LADY MACBETH Almost at odds with morning which is which
 MACBETH How sayst thou that Macduff denies his person
 At our great bidding
 LADY MACBETH Did you send to him sir
 MACBETH I hear it by the way but I will send
 Theres not a one of them but in his house
 I keep a servant feed I will tomorrow
 And betimes I will to the weird sisters
 More shall they speak for now I am bent to know
 By the worst means the worst For mine own good
 All causes shall give way I am in blood
 Steppd in so far that should I wade no more
 Returning were as tedious as go oer
 Strange things I have in head that will to hand
 Which must be acted ere they may be scannd
 LADY MACBETH You lack the season of all natures sleep
 MACBETH Come well to sleep My strange and self abuse 
 Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
 We are yet but young in deed Exeunt




SCENE V
A heath Thunder

Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate

 FIRST WITCH Why how now Hecate You look angerly
 HECATE Have I not reason beldams as you are
 Saucy and overbold How did you dare
 To trade and traffic with Macbeth
 In riddles and affairs of death
 And I the mistress of your charms
 The close contriver of all harms
 Was never calld to bear my part
 Or show the glory of our art
 And which is worse all you have done
 Hath been but for a wayward son
 Spiteful and wrathful who as others do
 Loves for his own ends not for you
 But make amends now Get you gone
 And at the pit of Acheron
 Meet me i the morning Thither he
 Will come to know his destiny 
 Your vessels and your spells provide
 Your charms and everything beside
 I am for the air this night Ill spend
 Unto a dismal and a fatal end
 Great business must be wrought ere noon
 Upon the corner of the moon
 There hangs a vaporous drop profound
 Ill catch it ere it come to ground
 And that distilld by magic sleights
 Shall raise such artificial sprites
 As by the strength of their illusion
 Shall draw him on to his confusion
 He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
 His hopes bove wisdom grace and fear
 And you all know security
 Is mortals chiefest enemy
 Music and a song within
 Come away come away
 Hark I am calld my little spirit see
 Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me Exit 
 FIRST WITCH Come lets make haste shell soon be back again
 Exeunt




SCENE VI
Forres The palace

Enter Lennox and another Lord

 LENNOX My former speeches have but hit your thoughts
 Which can interpret farther only I say
 Things have been strangely borne The gracious Duncan
 Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead
 And the right valiant Banquo walkd too late
 Whom you may say ift please you Fleance killd
 For Fleance fled Men must not walk too late
 Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
 It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
 To kill their gracious father Damned fact
 How it did grieve Macbeth Did he not straight
 In pious rage the two delinquents tear
 That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
 Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too
 For twould have angerd any heart alive
 To hear the men denyt So that I say
 He has borne all things well and I do think 
 That had he Duncans sons under his key 
 As ant please heaven he shall not they should find
 What twere to kill a father so should Fleance
 But peace For from broad words and cause he faild
 His presence at the tyrants feast I hear
 Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell
 Where he bestows himself
 LORD The son of Duncan
 From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
 Lives in the English court and is received
 Of the most pious Edward with such grace
 That the malevolence of fortune nothing
 Takes from his high respect Thither Macduff
 Is gone to pray the holy King upon his aid
 To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
 That by the help of these with Him above
 To ratify the work we may again
 Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
 Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
 Do faithful homage and receive free honors 
 All which we pine for now And this report
 Hath so exasperate the King that he
 Prepares for some attempt of war
 LENNOX Sent he to Macduff
 LORD He did and with an absolute Sir not I
 The cloudy messenger turns me his back
 And hums as who should say Youll rue the time
 That clogs me with this answer
 LENNOX And that well might
 Advise him to a caution to hold what distance
 His wisdom can provide Some holy angel
 Fly to the court of England and unfold
 His message ere he come that a swift blessing
 May soon return to this our suffering country
 Under a hand accursed
 LORD Ill send my prayers with him
 Exeunt

A cavern In the middle a boiling cauldron Thunder

Enter the three Witches
 FIRST WITCH Thrice the brinded cat hath mewd
 SECOND WITCH Thrice and once the hedge pig whined
 THIRD WITCH Harpier cries Tis time tis time
 FIRST WITCH Round about the cauldron go
 In the poisond entrails throw
 Toad that under cold stone
 Days and nights has thirty one
 Swelterd venom sleeping got
 Boil thou first i the charmed pot
 ALL Double double toil and trouble
 Fire burn and cauldron bubble
 SECOND WITCH Fillet of a fenny snake
 In the cauldron boil and bake
 Eye of newt and toe of frog
 Wool of bat and tongue of dog
 Adders fork and blind worms sting
 Lizards leg and howlets wing
 For a charm of powerful trouble 
 Like a hell broth boil and bubble
 ALL Double double toil and trouble
 Fire burn and cauldron bubble
 THIRD WITCH Scale of dragon tooth of wolf
 Witchs mummy maw and gulf
 Of the ravind salt sea shark
 Root of hemlock diggd i the dark
 Liver of blaspheming Jew
 Gall of goat and slips of yew

 Nose of Turk and Tartars lips
 Finger of birth strangled babe
 Ditch deliverd by a drab
 Make the gruel thick and slab
 Add thereto a tigers chawdron
 For the ingredients of our cawdron
 ALL Double double toil and trouble
 Fire burn and cauldron bubble
 SECOND WITCH Cool it with a baboons blood
 Then the charm is firm and good 

 Enter Hecate to the other three Witches

 HECATE O well done I commend your pains
 And everyone shall share i the gains
 And now about the cauldron sing
 Like elves and fairies in a ring
 Enchanting all that you put in
 Music and a song Black spirits
 Hecate retires
 SECOND WITCH By the pricking of my thumbs
 Something wicked this way comes
 Open locks
 Whoever knocks

 Enter Macbeth

 MACBETH How now you secret black and midnight hags
 What ist you do
 ALL A deed without a name 
 MACBETH I conjure you by that which you profess
 Howeer you come to know it answer me
 Though you untie the winds and let them fight
 Against the churches though the yesty waves
 Confound and swallow navigation up
 Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down
 Though castles topple on their warders heads

SCENE II
Fife Macduffs castle

Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross

 LADY MACDUFF What had he done to make him fly the land
 ROSS You must have patience madam
 LADY MACDUFF He had none
 His flight was madness When our actions do not
 Our fears do make us traitors
 ROSS You know not
 Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
 LADY MACDUFF Wisdom To leave his wife to leave his babes
 His mansion and his titles in a place
 From whence himself does fly He loves us not
 He wants the natural touch for the poor wren
 The most diminutive of birds will fight
 Her young ones in her nest against the owl
 All is the fear and nothing is the love
 As little is the wisdom where the flight
 So runs against all reason
 ROSS My dearest coz 
 I pray you school yourself But for your husband
 He is noble wise Judicious and best knows
 The fits o the season I dare not speak much further
 But cruel are the times when we are traitors
 And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor
 From what we fear yet know not what we fear
 But float upon a wild and violent sea
 Each way and move I take my leave of you
 Shall not be long but Ill be here again
 Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
 To what they were before My pretty cousin
 Blessing upon you
 LADY MACDUFF Fatherd he is and yet hes fatherless
 ROSS I am so much a fool should I stay longer
 It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
 I take my leave at once Exit
 LADY MACDUFF Sirrah your fathers dead
 And what will you do now How will you live
 SON As birds do Mother
 LADY MACDUFF What with worms and flies 
 SON With what I get I mean and so do they
 LADY MACDUFF Poor bird Thouldst never fear the net nor lime
 The pitfall nor the gin
 SON Why should I Mother Poor birds they are not set for
 My father is not dead for all your saying
 LADY MACDUFF Yes he is dead How wilt thou do for father
 SON Nay how will you do for a husband
 LADY MACDUFF Why I can buy me twenty at any market
 SON Then youll buy em to sell again
 LADY MACDUFF Thou speakst with all thy wit and yet i
faith
 With wit enough for thee
 SON Was my father a traitor Mother
 LADY MACDUFF Ay that he was
 SON What is a traitor
 LADY MACDUFF Why one that swears and lies
 SON And be all traitors that do so
 LADY MACDUFF Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be
 hanged
 SON And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
 LADY MACDUFF Everyone 
 SON Who must hang them
 LADY MACDUFF Why the honest men
 SON Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars
and
 swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them
 LADY MACDUFF Now God help thee poor monkey But how wilt
thou do
 for a father
 SON If he were dead yould weep for him if you would not it
 were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father
 LADY MACDUFF Poor prattler how thou talkst

 Enter a Messenger

 MESSENGER Bless you fair dame I am not to you known
 Though in your state of honor I am perfect
 I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
 If you will take a homely mans advice
 Be not found here hence with your little ones
 To fright you thus methinks I am too savage
 To do worse to you were fell cruelty
 Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you 
 I dare abide no longer Exit
 LADY MACDUFF Whither should I fly
 I have done no harm But I remember now
 I am in this earthly world where to do harm
 Is often laudable to do good sometime
 Accounted dangerous folly Why then alas
 Do I put up that womanly defense
 To say I have done no harm What are these faces

 Enter Murtherers

 FIRST MURTHERER Where is your husband
 LADY MACDUFF I hope in no place so unsanctified
 Where such as thou mayst find him
 FIRST MURTHERER Hes a traitor
 SON Thou liest thou shag eard villain
 FIRST MURTHERER What you egg
 Stabs him
 Young fry of treachery
 SON He has killd me Mother 
 Run away I pray you Dies
 Exit Lady Macduff crying Murther
 Exeunt Murtherers following her




SCENE III
England Before the Kings palace

Enter Malcolm and Macduff

 MALCOLM Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
 Weep our sad bosoms empty
 MACDUFF Let us rather
 Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
 Bestride our downfalln birthdom Each new morn
 New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
 Strike heaven on the face that it resounds
 As if it felt with Scotland and yelld out
 Like syllable of dolor
 MALCOLM What I believe Ill wall
 What know believe and what I can redress
 As I shall find the time to friend I will
 What you have spoke it may be so perchance
 This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
 Was once thought honest You have loved him well
 He hath not touchd you yet I am young but something
 You may deserve of him through me and wisdom 
 To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
 To appease an angry god
 MACDUFF I am not treacherous
 MALCOLM But Macbeth is
 A good and virtuous nature may recoil
 In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon
 That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
 Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
 Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
 Yet grace must still look so
 MACDUFF I have lost my hopes
 MALCOLM Perchance even there where I did find my doubts
 Why in that rawness left you wife and child
 Those precious motives those strong knots of love
 Without leave taking I pray you
 Let not my jealousies be your dishonors
 But mine own safeties You may be rightly just
 Whatever I shall think
 MACDUFF Bleed bleed poor country
 Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure 
 For goodness dare not check thee Wear thou thy wrongs
 The title is affeerd Fare thee well lord
 I would not be the villain that thou thinkst
 For the whole space thats in the tyrants grasp
 And the rich East to boot
 MALCOLM Be not offended
 I speak not as in absolute fear of you
 I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
 It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
 Is added to her wounds I think withal
 There would be hands uplifted in my right
 And here from gracious England have I offer
 Of goodly thousands But for all this
 When I shall tread upon the tyrants head
 Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
 Shall have more vices than it had before
 More suffer and more sundry ways than ever
 By him that shall succeed
 MACDUFF What should he be
 MALCOLM It is myself I mean in whom I know 
 All the particulars of vice so grafted
 That when they shall be opend black Macbeth
 Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
 Esteem him as a lamb being compared
 With my confineless harms
 MACDUFF Not in the legions
 Of horrid hell can come a devil more damnd
 In evils to top Macbeth
 MALCOLM I grant him bloody
 Luxurious avaricious false deceitful
 Sudden malicious smacking of every sin
 That has a name But theres no bottom none
 In my voluptuousness Your wives your daughters
 Your matrons and your maids could not fill up
 The cestern of my lust and my desire
 All continent impediments would oerbear
 That did oppose my will Better Macbeth
 Than such an one to reign
 MACDUFF Boundless intemperance
 In nature is a tyranny it hath been 
 The untimely emptying of the happy throne
 And fall of many kings But fear not yet
 To take upon you what is yours You may
 Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
 And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
 We have willing dames enough there cannot be
 That vulture in you to devour so many
 As will to greatness dedicate themselves
 Finding it so inclined
 MALCOLM With this there grows
 In my most ill composed affection such
 A stanchless avarice that were I King
 I should cut off the nobles for their lands
 Desire his jewels and this others house
 And my more having would be as a sauce
 To make me hunger more that I should forge
 Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
 Destroying them for wealth
 MACDUFF This avarice
 Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root 
 Than summer seeming lust and it hath been
 The sword of our slain kings Yet do not fear
 Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
 Of your mere own All these are portable
 With other graces weighd
 MALCOLM But I have none The king becoming graces
 As justice verity temperance stableness
 Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
 Devotion patience courage fortitude
 I have no relish of them but abound
 In the division of each several crime
 Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should
 Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
 Uproar the universal peace confound
 All unity on earth
 MACDUFF O Scotland Scotland
 MALCOLM If such a one be fit to govern speak
 I am as I have spoken
 MACDUFF Fit to govern
 No not to live O nation miserable 
 With an untitled tyrant bloody scepterd
 When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
 Since that the truest issue of thy throne
 By his own interdiction stands accursed
 And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father
 Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
 Oftener upon her knees than on her feet
 Died every day she lived Fare thee well
 These evils thou repeatst upon thyself
 Have banishd me from Scotland O my breast
 Thy hope ends here
 MALCOLM Macduff this noble passion
 Child of integrity hath from my soul
 Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
 To thy good truth and honor Devilish Macbeth
 By many of these trains hath sought to win me
 Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
 From over credulous haste But God above
 Deal between thee and me For even now
 I put myself to thy direction and 
 Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
 The taints and blames I laid upon myself
 For strangers to my nature I am yet
 Unknown to woman never was forsworn
 Scarcely have coveted what was mine own
 At no time broke my faith would not betray
 The devil to his fellow and delight
 No less in truth than life My first false speaking
 Was this upon myself What I am truly
 Is thine and my poor countrys to command
 Whither indeed before thy here approach
 Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men
 Already at a point was setting forth
 Now well together and the chance of goodness
 Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent
 MACDUFF Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
 Tis hard to reconcile

 Enter a Doctor
 
 MALCOLM Well more anon Comes the King forth I pray you
 DOCTOR Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
 That stay his cure Their malady convinces
 The great assay of art but at his touch
 Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
 They presently amend
 MALCOLM I thank you Doctor Exit Doctor
 MACDUFF Whats the disease he means
 MALCOLM Tis calld the evil
 A most miraculous work in this good King
 Which often since my here remain in England
 I have seen him do How he solicits heaven
 Himself best knows but strangely visited people
 All swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eye
 The mere despair of surgery he cures
 Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
 Put on with holy prayers and tis spoken
 To the succeeding royalty he leaves
 The healing benediction With this strange virtue
 He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy 
 And sundry blessings hang about his throne
 That speak him full of grace

 Enter Ross

 MACDUFF See who comes here
 MALCOLM My countryman but yet I know him not
 MACDUFF My ever gentle cousin welcome hither
 MALCOLM I know him now Good God betimes remove
 The means that makes us strangers
 ROSS Sir amen
 MACDUFF Stands Scotland where it did
 ROSS Alas poor country
 Almost afraid to know itself It cannot
 Be calld our mother but our grave Where nothing
 But who knows nothing is once seen to smile
 Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
 Are made not markd where violent sorrow seems
 A modern ecstasy The dead mans knell
 Is there scarce askd for who and good mens lives 
 Expire before the flowers in their caps
 Dying or ere they sicken
 MACDUFF O relation
 Too nice and yet too true
 MALCOLM Whats the newest grief
 ROSS That of an hours age doth hiss the speaker
 Each minute teems a new one
 MACDUFF How does my wife
 ROSS Why well
 MACDUFF And all my children
 ROSS Well too
 MACDUFF The tyrant has not batterd at their peace
 ROSS No they were well at peace when I did leave em
 MACDUFF Be not a niggard of your speech How goest
 ROSS When I came hither to transport the tidings
 Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor
 Of many worthy fellows that were out
 Which was to my belief witnessd the rather
 For that I saw the tyrants power afoot
 Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland 
 Would create soldiers make our women fight
 To doff their dire distresses
 MALCOLM Bet their comfort
 We are coming thither Gracious England hath
 Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men
 An older and a better soldier none
 That Christendom gives out
 ROSS Would I could answer
 This comfort with the like But I have words
 That would be howld out in the desert air
 Where hearing should not latch them
 MACDUFF What concern they
 The general cause Or is it a fee grief
 Due to some single breast
 ROSS No mind thats honest
 But in it shares some woe though the main part
 Pertains to you alone
 MACDUFF If it be mine
 Keep it not from me quickly let me have it
 ROSS Let not your ears despise my tongue forever 
 Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
 That ever yet they heard
 MACDUFF Humh I guess at it
 ROSS Your castle is surprised your wife and babes
 Savagely slaughterd To relate the manner
 Were on the quarry of these murtherd deer
 To add the death of you
 MALCOLM Merciful heaven
 What man Neer pull your hat upon your brows
 Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak
 Whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break
 MACDUFF My children too
 ROSS Wife children servants all
 That could be found
 MACDUFF And I must be from thence
 My wife killd too
 ROSS I have said
 MALCOLM Be comforted
 Lets make us medicines of our great revenge
 To cure this deadly grief 
 MACDUFF He has no children All my pretty ones
 Did you say all O hell kite All
 What all my pretty chickens and their dam
 At one fell swoop
 MALCOLM Dispute it like a man
 MACDUFF I shall do so
 But I must also feel it as a man
 I cannot but remember such things were
 That were most precious to me Did heaven look on
 And would not take their part Sinful Macduff
 They were all struck for thee Naught that I am
 Not for their own demerits but for mine
 Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now
 MALCOLM Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief
 Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
 MACDUFF O I could play the woman with mine eyes
 And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens
 Cut short all intermission front to front
 Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
 Within my swords length set him if he scape 
 Heaven forgive him too
 MALCOLM This tune goes manly
 Come go we to the King our power is ready
 Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth
 Is ripe for shaking and the powers above
 Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may
 The night is long that never finds the day Exeunt

her
 rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her
 closet take forth paper fold it write upont read it
 afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this
while

 DOCTOR A great perturbation in nature to receive at once the
 benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this
slumbery
 agitation besides her walking and other actual performances
 what at any time have you heard her say
 GENTLEWOMAN That sir which I will not report after her
 DOCTOR You may to me and tis most meet you should

 GENTLEWOMAN It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus
 washing her hands I have known her continue in this a
quarter of
 an hour
 LADY MACBETH Yet heres a spot
 DOCTOR Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from her
to
 satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
 LADY MACBETH Out damned spot Out I say One two why then
tis
 time to dot Hell is murky Fie my lord fie A soldier
and
 afeard What need we fear who knows it when none can call
our
 power to account Yet who would have thought the old man to
have
 had so much blood in him 
 DOCTOR Do you mark that
 LADY MACBETH The Thane of Fife had a wife where is she now
What
 will these hands neer be clean No more o that my lord no
more

 DOCTOR Go to go to you have known what you should not
 GENTLEWOMAN She has spoke what she should not I am sure of
that
 Heaven knows what she has known
 LADY MACBETH Heres the smell of the blood still All the
perfumes
 of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand Oh oh oh
 DOCTOR What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged
 GENTLEWOMAN I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
 dignity of the whole body
 DOCTOR Well well well 
 GENTLEWOMAN Pray God it be sir

those
 which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in
their

undone
 To bed to bed to bed
Exit
 DOCTOR Will she go now to bed
 GENTLEWOMAN Directly
 DOCTOR Foul whisperings are abroad Unnatural deeds
 Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
 To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
 More needs she the divine than the physician
 God God forgive us all Look after her
 Remove from her the means of all annoyance
 And still keep eyes upon her So good night
 My mind she has mated and amazed my sight
 I think but dare not speak
 GENTLEWOMAN Good night good doctor
 Exeunt




SCENE II
The country near Dunsinane Drum and colors

Enter Menteith Caithness Angus Lennox and Soldiers

 MENTEITH The English power is near led on by Malcolm
 His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
 Revenges burn in them for their dear causes
 Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
 Excite the mortified man
 ANGUS Near Birnam Wood
 Shall we well meet them that way are they coming
 CAITHNESS Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
 LENNOX For certain sir he is not I have a file
 Of all the gentry There is Sewards son
 And many unrough youths that even now
 Protest their first of manhood
 MENTEITH What does the tyrant
 CAITHNESS Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
 Some say hes mad others that lesser hate him
 Do call it valiant fury but for certain
 He cannot buckle his distemperd cause 
 Within the belt of rule
 ANGUS Now does he feel
 His secret murthers sticking on his hands
 Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach
 Those he commands move only in command
 Nothing in love Now does he feel his title
 Hang loose about him like a giants robe
 Upon a dwarfish thief
 MENTEITH Who then shall blame
 His pesterd senses to recoil and start
 When all that is within him does condemn
 Itself for being there
 CAITHNESS Well march we on
 To give obedience where tis truly owed
 Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
 And with him pour we in our countrys purge
 Each drop of us
 LENNOX Or so much as it needs
 To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
 Make we our march towards Birnam Exeunt marching




SCENE III
Dunsinane A room in the castle

Enter Macbeth Doctor and Attendants

 MACBETH Bring me no more reports let them fly all
 Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
 I cannot taint with fear Whats the boy Malcolm
 Was he not born of woman The spirits that know
 All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus
 Fear not Macbeth no man thats born of woman
 Shall eer have power upon thee Then fly false Thanes
 And mingle with the English epicures
 The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
 Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear

 Enter a Servant

 The devil damn thee black thou cream faced loon
 Where gotst thou that goose look
 SERVANT There is ten thousand 
 MACBETH Geese villain 
 SERVANT Soldiers sir
 MACBETH Go prick thy face and over red thy fear
 Thou lily liverd boy What soldiers patch
 Death of thy soul Those linen cheeks of thine
 Are counselors to fear What soldiers whey face
 SERVANT The English force so please you
 MACBETH Take thy face hence Exit Servant
 Seyton I am sick at heart
 When I behold Seyton I say This push
 Will cheer me ever or disseat me now
 I have lived long enough My way of life
 Is falln into the sear the yellow leaf
 And that which should accompany old age
 As honor love obedience troops of friends
 I must not look to have but in their stead
 Curses not loud but deep mouth honor breath
 Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
 Seyton

 Enter Seyton 

 SEYTON Whats your gracious pleasure
 MACBETH What news more
 SEYTON All is confirmd my lord which was reported
 MACBETH Ill fight til from my bones my flesh be hackd
 Give me my armor
 SEYTON Tis not needed yet
 MACBETH Ill put it on
 Send out more horses skirr the country round
 Hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armor
 How does your patient doctor
 DOCTOR Not so sick my lord
 As she is troubled with thick coming fancies
 That keep her from her rest
 MACBETH Cure her of that
 Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
 Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
 Raze out the written troubles of the brain
 And with some sweet oblivious antidote
 Cleanse the stuffd bosom of that perilous stuff 
 Which weighs upon the heart
 DOCTOR Therein the patient
 Must minister to himself
 MACBETH Throw physic to the dogs Ill none of it
 Come put mine armor on give me my staff
 Seyton send out Doctor the Thanes fly from me
 Come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast
 The water of my land find her disease
 And purge it to a sound and pristine health
 I would applaud thee to the very echo
 That should applaud again Pullt off I say
 What rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug
 Would scour these English hence Hearst thou of them
 DOCTOR Ay my good lord your royal preparation
 Makes us hear something
 MACBETH Bring it after me
 I will not be afraid of death and bane
 Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane
 DOCTOR Aside Were I from Dunsinane away and clear
 Profit again should hardly draw me here Exeunt




SCENE IV
Country near Birnam Wood Drum and colors

Enter Malcolm old Seward and his Son Macduff Menteith
Caithness
Angus Lennox Ross and Soldiers marching

 MALCOLM Cousins I hope the days are near at hand
 That chambers will be safe
 MENTEITH We doubt it nothing
 SIWARD What wood is this before us
 MENTEITH The Wood of Birnam
 MALCOLM Let every soldier hew him down a bough
 And beart before him thereby shall we shadow
 The numbers of our host and make discovery
 Err in report of us
 SOLDIERS It shall be done
 SIWARD We learn no other but the confident tyrant
 Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
 Our setting down beforet
 MALCOLM Tis his main hope
 For where there is advantage to be given
 Both more and less have given him the revolt 
 And none serve with him but constrained things
 Whose hearts are absent too
 MACDUFF Let our just censures
 Attend the true event and put we on
 Industrious soldiership
 SIWARD The time approaches
 That will with due decision make us know
 What we shall say we have and what we owe
 Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
 But certain issue strokes must arbitrate
 Towards which advance the war
 Exeunt Marching




SCENE V
Dunsinane Within the castle

Enter Macbeth Seyton and Soldiers with drum and colors

 MACBETH Hang out our banners on the outward walls
 The cry is still They come Our castles strength
 Will laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie
 Till famine and the ague eat them up
 Were they not forced with those that should be ours
 We might have met them dareful beard to beard
 And beat them backward home
 A cry of women within
 What is that noise
 SEYTON It is the cry of women my good lord Exit
 MACBETH I have almost forgot the taste of fears
 The time has been my senses would have coold
 To hear a night shriek and my fell of hair
 Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
 As life were int I have suppd full with horrors
 Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
 Cannot once start me 

 Re enter Seyton
 Wherefore was that cry
 SEYTON The Queen my lord is dead
 MACBETH She should have died hereafter
 There would have been a time for such a word
 Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
 Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
 To the last syllable of recorded time
 And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
 The way to dusty death Out out brief candle
 Lifes but a walking shadow a poor player
 That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
 And then is heard no more It is a tale
 Told by an idiot full of sound and fury
 Signifying nothing

 Enter a Messenger

 Thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly 
 MESSENGER Gracious my lord
 I should report that which I say I saw
 But know not how to do it
 MACBETH Well say sir
 MESSENGER As I did stand my watch upon the hill
 I lookd toward Birnam and anon methought
 The Wood began to move
 MACBETH Liar and slave
 MESSENGER Let me endure your wrath ift be not so
 Within this three mile may you see it coming
 I say a moving grove
 MACBETH If thou speakst false
 Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
 Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
 I care not if thou dost for me as much
 I pull in resolution and begin
 To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
 That lies like truth Fear not till Birnam Wood
 Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood
 Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out 
 If this which he avouches does appear
 There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
 I gin to be aweary of the sun
 And wish the estate o the world were now undone
 Ring the alarum bell Blow wind Come wrack
 At least well die with harness on our back Exeunt




SCENE VI
Dunsinane Before the castle

Enter Malcolm old Siward Macduff and their Army with boughs
Drum and colors

 MALCOLM Now near enough your leavy screens throw down
 And show like those you are You worthy uncle
 Shall with my cousin your right noble son
 Lead our first battle Worthy Macduff and we
 Shall take upon s what else remains to do
 According to our order
 SIWARD Fare you well
 Do we but find the tyrants power tonight
 Let us be beaten if we cannot fight
 MACDUFF Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath
 Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death
 Exeunt




SCENE VII
Dunsinane Before the castle Alarums

Enter Macbeth

 MACBETH They have tied me to a stake I cannot fly
 But bear like I must fight the course Whats he
 That was not born of woman Such a one
 Am I to fear or none

 Enter young Siward

 YOUNG SIWARD What is thy name
 MACBETH Thoult be afraid to hear it
 YOUNG SIWARD No though thou callst thyself a hotter name
 Than any is in hell
 MACBETH My names Macbeth
 YOUNG SIWARD The devil himself could not pronounce a title
 More hateful to mine ear
 MACBETH No nor more fearful
 YOUNG SIWARD O Thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
 Ill prove the lie thou speakst 
 They fight and young Seward is slain
 MACBETH Thou wast born of woman
 But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
 Brandishd by man thats of a woman born Exit

 Alarums Enter Macduff

 MACDUFF That way the noise is Tyrant show thy face
 If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine
 My wife and childrens ghosts will haunt me still
 I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
 Are hired to bear their staves Either thou Macbeth
 Or else my sword with an unbatterd edge
 I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
 By this great clatter one of greatest note
 Seems bruited Let me find him Fortune
 And more I beg not Exit Alarums

 Enter Malcolm and old Siward
 
 SIWARD This way my lord the castles gently renderd
 The tyrants people on both sides do fight
 The noble Thanes do bravely in the war
 The day almost itself professes yours
 And little is to do
 MALCOLM We have met with foes
 That strike beside us
 SIWARD Enter sir the castle
 Exeunt Alarum




SCENE VIII
Another part of the field

Enter Macbeth

 MACBETH Why should I play the Roman fool and die
 On mine own sword Whiles I see lives the gashes
 Do better upon them

 Enter Macduff

 MACDUFF Turn hell hound turn
 MACBETH Of all men else I have avoided thee
 But get thee back my soul is too much charged
 With blood of thine already
 MACDUFF I have no words
 My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
 Than terms can give thee out They fight
 MACBETH Thou losest labor
 As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
 With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
 Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests 
 I bear a charmed life which must not yield
 To one of woman born
 MACDUFF Despair thy charm
 And let the angel whom thou still hast served
 Tell thee Macduff was from his mothers womb
 Untimely rippd
 MACBETH Accursed be that tongue that tells me so
 For it hath cowd my better part of man
 And be these juggling fiends no more believed
 That patter with us in a double sense
 That keep the word of promise to our ear
 And break it to our hope Ill not fight with thee
 MACDUFF Then yield thee coward
 And live to be the show and gaze o the time
 Well have thee as our rarer monsters are
 Painted upon a pole and underwrit
 Here may you see the tyrant
 MACBETH I will not yield
 To kiss the ground before young Malcolms feet
 And to be baited with the rabbles curse 
 Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
 And thou opposed being of no woman born
 Yet I will try the last Before my body
 I throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff
 And damnd be him that first cries Hold enough
 Exeunt fighting Alarums




SCENE IX

Retreat Flourish Enter with drum and colors Malcolm old
Siward Ross
the other Thanes and Soldiers

 MALCOLM I would the friends we miss were safe arrived
 SIWARD Some must go off and yet by these I see
 So great a day as this is cheaply bought
 MALCOLM Macduff is missing and your noble son
 ROSS Your son my lord has paid a soldiers debt
 He only lived but till he was a man
 The which no sooner had his prowess confirmd
 In the unshrinking station where he fought
 But like a man he died
 SIWARD Then he is dead
 ROSS Ay and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow
 Must not be measured by his worth for then
 It hath no end
 SIWARD Had he his hurts before
 ROSS Ay on the front
 SIWARD Why then Gods soldier be he
 Had I as many sons as I have hairs 
 I would not wish them to a fairer death
 And so his knell is knolld
 MALCOLM Hes worth more sorrow
 And that Ill spend for him
 SIWARD Hes worth no more
 They say he parted well and paid his score
 And so God be with him Here comes newer comfort

 Re enter Macduff with Macbeths head

 MACDUFF Hail King for so thou art Behold where stands
 The usurpers cursed head The time is free
 I see thee compassd with thy kingdoms pearl
 That speak my salutation in their minds
 Whose voices I desire aloud with mine 
 Hail King of Scotland
 ALL Hail King of Scotland Flourish
 MALCOLM We shall not spend a large expense of time
 Before we reckon with your several loves
 And make us even with you My Thanes and kinsmen 
 Henceforth be Earls the first that ever Scotland
 In such an honor named Whats more to do
 Which would be planted newly with the time
 As calling home our exiled friends abroad
 That fled the snares of watchful tyranny
 Producing forth the cruel ministers
 Of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen
 Who as tis thought by self and violent hands
 Took off her life this and what needful else
 That calls upon us by the grace of Grace
 We will perform in measure time and place
 So thanks to all at once and to each one
 Whom we invite to see us crownd at Scone
 Flourish Exeunt
 THE END
